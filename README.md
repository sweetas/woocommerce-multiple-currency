woocommerce-multiple-currency
=============================

<h1>Intro</h1>

It was a competition between 2 friends, who can develop plugin as soon as possible, so it was made in 3 hours without any knowledge of wordpress & woocommerce frameworks.

Open source solution to show prices in 2 currencies: Lithuanian Litas and Euro. 

The project evolved from government requirement to show prices in 2 different currencies through integration period.

It has some ugly PHP code, so if you want - you can change it by yourself. 

It works with Woocommerce Version 2.1.12 with other versions it could have bugs, because for easier integration in woocommerce, it takes HTML code from woocommerce core and parses it.

<h1>Usage</h1>

Copy all code (without <?php and ?> tags :) ) from functions.php to your wordpress functions.php file.

<h1>Price</h1>
Donate some money to charity!
